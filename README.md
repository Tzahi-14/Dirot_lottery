# Dirot_lottery
I've created this project to get notifications from Israeli goverment program called "price Per occupant".
The reason I've built this project is because there isn't any option to get notifications for new lottries in this program, and since I don't want to miss it, and I don't want to enter thier website every day, so I've built short script and schdule it with digitalocean server to check every day for new lottry.
If there's new lottry I'm getting email to my gmail, and SMS using thirdparty service called nexmo.
